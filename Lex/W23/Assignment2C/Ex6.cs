Write an employee class and a client class that are descendants of the person class. 
Implement a salary property on the employee class and create a constructor that calls the base person class constructor passing the information it needs. 
On both classes, override the ToString-method and let them return a distinct message depending whether they’re clients and employees. 
Call the method you created in exercise 3 with both an employee and a client object.
