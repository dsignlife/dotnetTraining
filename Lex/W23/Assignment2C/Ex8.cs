            Calculating some sales statistics
Just storing each sales does not do us much good since the company is interested in how many sales an employee has made and how much money he have earned for the company.
Now, they want you to create a few methods in the employee class that calculates these things. 
Let the first method be GetNumberOfSales(), which returns the number of sales. 
Let the second method be GetSalesTotal() that sums up the money sold for each element.
Let the third method be to calculate the average sale for the employee. 
Then lastly, create a method that prints out the sales statistics for a specific employee.
