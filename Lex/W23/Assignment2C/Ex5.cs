            Counting the number of Person-objects created
In this example, we are going to write the functionality for keeping count of the number of person object created. 
Write a static integer variable in the person class, and write a static method that increases this variable by one each time it’s called and one method that returns the current value.
Where could we call this method, so that it increases each time we create a new person?
