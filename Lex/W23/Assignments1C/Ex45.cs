         Create a program that can shuffle a deck of cards. 
         The cards can be represented as an array of integers, like [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,…n]. 
         Then make it possible to draw 1 card from the deck and add to another array.
         (The card should then disappear from the card deck and appear in the array with the drawn cards. 
         Tip: You can use Array.Resize( ref array, newSize) to change the size of an existing array, and Array.Copy.
         There is however not a requirement that the array needs to be in a specific order after a card has been drawn.
         Complete the functions below. 
         static int DrawCard(ref int[] deck) { // code to draw a card here 
         } static void ShuffleCards(int[] deck) { // code to shuffle the deck here }
             */
